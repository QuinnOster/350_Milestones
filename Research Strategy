My research strategy hasn't changed very much over the semester, as I have developed it over several years of web development. 

I always check my own work first if it's something I've done before, and modify it to fit the current project.

If I cannot find what I need in my own files, I search online. I usually look for official documentation first, and then move on to stackoverflow and other relevant forums. I always open the documentation for terms in the code snippets I find in stackoverflow so that I am sure I understand what I am putting in my project.
